Welcome to RepoRadar: Your First AI-Powered Analysis

When exploring GitHub, it's easy to judge a project by its surface-level metrics. We see thousands of stars or hundreds of forks and assume a repository is healthy, useful, and well-maintained. But these numbers don't tell the whole story; they can be misleading, leaving you to guess about a project's true quality and risks. RepoRadar is built on a high-performance, enterprise-ready foundation designed to look deeper, providing clear, AI-driven insights that help you understand the story behind the numbers. It provides actionable intelligence, not just more data.

We don’t dump stats. We explain what they mean and what to do next.

This guide will walk you through your first analysis, showing you how RepoRadar transforms raw repository data into clear signals so you can make confident decisions in minutes, not days. Let's walk through how that process works in three simple steps.

1. How It Works: Your First Analysis in 3 Simple Steps

Getting a comprehensive, AI-backed report on any public GitHub repository is a straightforward three-step process.

1. Paste a GitHub URL Start your analysis by simply pasting a repository URL into the search bar or by searching with keywords.
2. Let the AI Analyze RepoRadar fetches key repository signals—such as issues, pull requests, releases, and dependencies—and applies its advanced scoring model.
3. Get a Clear Report You receive an easy-to-understand report complete with scores, trends, plain-English summaries, and concrete recommendations.

2. Understanding Your Report: The Four Key Metrics

At the heart of every analysis are four key metrics focused on actionable intelligence. We distill complex project signals into these core areas so you can immediately assess a repository's practical viability.

Metric	What It Means for You
Health	Measures the overall stability and maintenance quality.
Velocity	Assesses the release and pull request merge cadence and responsiveness.
Risk	Gauges the "bus factor," single-maintainer risk, and archival signals.
Security	Rates the dependency freshness and presence of known vulnerabilities.

These scores, combined with the AI-generated summary and recommendations, give you a complete and actionable picture of a project's quality. While a single report is powerful, RepoRadar's true strength lies in evaluating projects at scale. Let's explore the core features that make this possible.

3. Exploring Core Features for Deeper Insights

Beyond a single analysis, RepoRadar has powerful features to help you evaluate, compare, and discover projects more efficiently.

* Batch Analysis Save time by processing multiple repositories at once. This feature allows you to compare results side-by-side in a clear table to make confident decisions. The free tier allows you to analyze up to 3 repositories per batch.
* Find Similar Repositories This AI-powered feature helps you discover alternative projects. You can find look-alikes based on functionality or similar quality metrics, making it easy to spot up-and-coming alternatives or related tools.
* Exports & Sharing Generate clean, professional PDF and CSV reports from any analysis. These reports are designed to be easily understood, allowing you to share your findings with teammates, clients, or other stakeholders in minutes.
